- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SailorSodium
I'm in the drive-thru of Burger King
Can I please get a Whopper Jr. with onion rings?
Make it a meal so I can get a drink
No, I'm not finished, that's not everything
Can I please get a double Whopper with no cheese?
Can I please get a number two with a large drink?
I got money, so I don't care how much it costs me
So just throw in some extra fries, don't make them salty
All this cheese gonna make my booty drip-drip
I'm lactose intolerant, I don't sip milk
If I see the sight of cheese, I'ma trip-trip
I'ma sit on your toilet seat and doodoo then dip
